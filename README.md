# DockerMinecraft

Dockerising my existing Ubuntu Minecraft server

The latest version of this Docker image is available on the Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/donaldsimpson/dockerminecraft/

This is basically working now, but it needs cleaning up and organising.
Next steps:
- adding a decent mechanism for specfying (loading/saving) Worlds from local volumes
- adding in default port binding options
- look at creating a Pixelmon/Forge version too
